# Melody Spawner
Melody Spawner is a Max for Live MIDI device for generation and development of monophonic melodies. Get inspired or create a melody outright directly inside Ableton Live's clips.

If you want to learn more about how this device functions, visit the [official page](https://janzaion.pro/projects/Melody-Spawner).

Production build of Max for Live devices requires special care. For this purpose, I have created a [separate repo](https://github.com/JanZaion/melody-spawner-production).

If you think you can improve this device or improve upon it, fell free to fork it or raise an issue.

Have fun with MIDI!
